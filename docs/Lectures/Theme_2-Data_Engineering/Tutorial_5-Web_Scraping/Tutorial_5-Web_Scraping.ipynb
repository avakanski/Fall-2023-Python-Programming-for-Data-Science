    "Before we begin with web scraping and Python, here are some important rules to follow and understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Always be respectful and try to get premission to scrape. Do not bombard a website with scraping requests, otherwise your IP address may be blocked.\n",
    "2. Be aware that websites change often, meaning your code could go from working to totally broken from one day to the next.\n",
    "3. Pretty much every web scraping project is a unique and custom job, so try your best to generalize the skills learned here.\n",

    "## Basic components of a WebSite\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML stands for  Hypertext Markup Language and every website on the Internet uses it to display information. Even the Jupyter Notebook system uses it to display this information in your browser. If you right-click on a website and select \"View Page Source\" you can see the raw HTML of a web page. This is the information that Python will be looking at to grab information from. Let's take a look at a simple webpage's HTML:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    <!DOCTYPE html>  \n",
    "    <html>  \n",

    "            <p> Some Paragraph </p>\n",

    "\n",
    "Every `<tag>` indicates a specific block type on the webpage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the tag for type declaration that HTML documents always start with this, letting the browser know its an HTML file.\n",
    "2. The component blocks of the HTML document are placed between `<html>` and `</html>`. \n",
    "3. Meta data and script connections (like a link to a CSS file or a JS file) are often placed in the `<head>` block.\n",
    "4. The `<title>` tag block defines the title of the webpage (this is what shows up in the tab of a website you're visiting).\n",
    "5. Between `<body>` and `</body>` tags are the blocks that will be visible to the site visitor.\n",
    "6. Headings are defined by the `<h1>` through `<h6>` tags, where the number represents the size of the heading.\n",
    "7. Paragraphs are defined by the `<p>` tag, and this is essentially just normal text on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more tags than these, such as `<a>` for hyperlinks, `<table>` for tables, `<tr>` for table rows, `<td>` for table columns, and more."

    "### CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is what gives \"style\" to a website, including colors and fonts, and even some animations. CSS uses tags such as `<id>` or `<class>` to connect an HTML element to a CSS feature, such as a particular color. The **id** tag is a unique id for an HTML tag and must be unique within the HTML document. The **class** tag defines a general style that can be linked to multiple HTML tags. Basically if you only want a single html tag to be read, you would use an id tag, and if you wanted several HTML tags/blocks to be read, you would create a class in your CSS doc, and then link it to the rest of these blocks."
