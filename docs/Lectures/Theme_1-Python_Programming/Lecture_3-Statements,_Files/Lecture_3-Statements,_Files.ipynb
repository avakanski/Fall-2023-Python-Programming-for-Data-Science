    "> **Expressions** are part of statements that return a value, such as variables, operators, or function calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, expressions in Python include `2+5`, or `x+3`, or `x * y` for given `x` and `y`, or `func1(3)` for a given function `func1`, since they all return a value. Expressions perform operations upon objects, and produce a value that can be used in other operations, can be assigned to a variable, printed out, etc. An expression can be part of larger expressions of statements. For instance, in the statement `a = 2 + 5`, the part `2 + 5` is an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Statements** are sections of code that perform an action. The main groups of Python statements are: assignment statements, print statements, conditional statements (`if`, `break`, `continue`, `try`), and looping statements (`for`, `while`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, `a = 2 + 5` is a statement, because it doesn't return a value, but it performs an action by assigning the value `5` to the variable `a`. Beside assignment statements (such as `a = 2 + 5`), other forms of statements include conditional statements (e.g., `if x > 5:`), looping statements (e.g., `for i in range(10):`), print statements (e.g., `print('hi')`), as well as there are several other statements, such as `import`, `return`, `pass`, etc. Note again that none of these statements returns a value in the way expressions do. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Modules** are Python files that contain Python statements, and are also called scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a module is a single Python script that is composed of a series of related statements grouped into one file. The statements in a module can assign values to variables, create functions or classes, or perform other actions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Packages** are Python programs that collect related modules together within a single directory hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a package is a directory that contains a collection of module files. Packages can also contain sub-packages, forming a hierarchy of packages. A Python program can be organized into a single package, or more complex programs can use multiple packages to achieve its functionality.\n",

    "The `if` statement takes the form of an `if test`, which can be followed by one or more optional `elif (else if) tests`, and a final optional `else test`. Each of the tests has an associated block of nested statements, indented under a header line.\n",

As we explained, the Python interpreter reads the statements in source files and converts them into byte code files, which are afterwards executed by the PVM. Conversely, Java, C, and C++ belong to the group of **compiled languages**. In these languages, a compiler converts the statements in source files into binary machine code, which is afterwards executed by the computer hardware.

Consequently, running Python programs is slower than running C or C++ programs, because the code is interpreted as it is executed. On the other hand, writing and testing Python programs is faster and easier than writing and testing programs using compiled languages.
