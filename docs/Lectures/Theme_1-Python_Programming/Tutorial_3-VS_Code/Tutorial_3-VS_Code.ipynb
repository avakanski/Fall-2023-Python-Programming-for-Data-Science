    "> An **IDE (or Integrated Development Environment)** is a program that integrates tools to facilitate software development, such as a code editor, tools for program execution and debugging, and source control.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, an IDE is a graphical user interface for program development, that allows end-users to edit, run, browse, and debug programs from a single interface. Using an IDE is especially convenient for beginners to start editing and running codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most IDEs support several different programming languages. There are some that are designed specifically for Python development (like the IDLE described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, most IDEs offer a **code editor**, although the code editor can be an independent software application. A code editor can be a simple text editor, or it can also allow code execution and debugging. In comparison to IDEs, code editors are simpler, but they are also less resource-demanding."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "In general, IDEs offer the following basic features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save and reload code files\n",
    "- Run code from within the environment\n",
    "- Debugging support\n",
    "- Syntax highlighting\n",
    "- Automatic code formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "The debugging support typically allows setting breakpoints in the code that stop the execution, showing variable values, and so on. For simpler debugging operations, most IDEs allow clicking on the text of an error message to quickly jump to the line of code where the error occurred, and after correcting the error, to quickly run the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax highlighting refers to displaying source code using different colors and fonts according to the category of the written text and commands. It facilitates code writing by providing visually distinct syntax, and it can help to identify mistakes in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic code formatting can include features such as automated indentation, automated spacing around operators, auto-completion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other helpful features often include: advanced text and file search options, help links or pop-up windows when hovering with the mouse over an object, selection list for object attributes (e.g., after a `.` press the `Tab` key), links to definition of objects, and similar."

    "\n",
    "The name is a variation of IDE, and it is named after one of the members of the Monty Python group - Eric Idle. \n",
    "\n",
    "To access IDLE, type in the Windows Command Prompt: `python -m idlelib.idle`. The IDLE window is shown in the figure below. Notice the `>>>` prompt in IDLE, which allows interactive programming, i.e., we can type commands and run them immediately. Also note the syntax highlighting of the entered Python statements, and the menu bar on the top of the window that is similar to the Jupyter Notebook menu and to other MS Office apps (e.g., MS Word).\n",
    "\n",
    "IDLE is simple to use and recommended for newcomers because it simplifies some details and does not assume prior experience with system command lines. On the other hand, it is somewhat limited compared to more advanced commercial IDEs."
