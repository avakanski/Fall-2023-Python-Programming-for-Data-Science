    "**Object-oriented programming** (OOP) is a programming approach to structuring programs based on the concept of **objects**, which can contain *data* and *behavior* in the form of *attributes* and *methods*, respectively. For instance, an object could represent a person with attributes like name, age, and address, and methods such as walking, talking, and running. Or, it could represent an email with attributes like a recipient list, subject, and body, and methods like adding attachments and sending.\n",

    "In OOP, computer programs are designed by defining objects that interact with one another. In Python, the main tool for achieving OOP are Python **classes**. Classes are created using the <code>class</code> statement. Then, from classes we can construct object **instances**, which are specific objects created from a particular class. \n",
