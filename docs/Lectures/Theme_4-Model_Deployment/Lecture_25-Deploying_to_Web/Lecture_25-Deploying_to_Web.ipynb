    "After a predictive model for a Data Science (DS) project is developed, the next steps in the project life cycle include deploying the model and serving the model to the end-users. One approach to serving the model is via a web API where the end-users can submit requests to query the model, and obtain the model's predictions as responses to their queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, an **API (Application Programming Interface)** enables software applications to communicate with each other and exchange data. In the context of web APIs, the terms client and server are typically used to refer to the two main components that are involved in the communication between software applications over the web. The **client** is typically a front-end application that runs in a web browser and allows to access data or services from the server. The client sends a *request* to the server, usually in the form of an HTTP request. The **server** is the application that receives and processes requests from clients. The server performs actions based on the requests, and sends a *response* back to the client. When a response is received from the server, the client presents the data to the end-users and/or it may take other actions based on the response from the server.\n",

    "An example of usage of a web API in Data Science is for accessing predictions from a model that is deployed on a server. The end-user interacts with a front-end application that runs in a web browser and submits a request to initiate an API call (e.g., submit an image for classification or submit tabular data inputs for classification). The API calls the server to obtain predictions from the model. After the model makes the prediction, the API transfers the prediction to the end-user in the form of JSON, XML, CSV, or another format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, another use of web APIs in Data Science is for accessing data from a database that is hosted on a server, and afterward using the retrieved data to train a predictive model.  "

    "Two common approaches for building web APIs are SOAP (Service Object Access Protocol) and REST (REpresentational State Transfer). Whereas SOAP is a protocol for communication between computer systems, REST is an architecture that defines a set of constraints for communication over a network and promotes simplicity, scalability, and reliability. Because of that, REST has been very popular, since it introduces guidelines regarding the architecture of an API, instead of defining rules of specifications for the data exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST (REpresentational State Transfer)** defines the following architectural constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stateless**: The server won’t maintain any state between requests from the client, and every request must contain all necessary information. I.e., the server cannot use information from previous requests by the client.\n",
    "- **Client-server design**: The client and server must be decoupled from each other. The decoupling helps them to evolve independently.\n",
    "- **Cacheable**: The response from the server should be cacheable, and it can be reused later by the client, if needed.\n",
    "- **Uniform interface**: The data transfer from the server to the client will be in a standardized format, instead of a format that is specific to one application.  \n",
    "- **Layered system**: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers. Also, the server can have multiple layers, such as security, application, business logic, and these layers must remain invisible to the client.\n",
    "- **Code on demand**: The client may extend functionalities by downloading code blocks from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API that adheres to the REST guidelines is referred to as **RESTful API** or simply REST API. \n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs provide access to web services through public web URLs, referred to as request endpoints. The client sends an HTTP request to the specific URL, and the RESTful API uses HTTP methods to manage the resources in the web service. Although there are many HTTP methods, the most commonly used methods with RESTful APIs include: `GET` (retrieve resources), `POST` (create a new resource), `PUT` (update an existing resource),` PATCH` (partially update an existing resource), and `DELETE` (delete a resource).

    "RESTful APIs can be developed in different programming languages. Examples of libraries include Node.js in Javascript, Roda and Sinatra in Ruby, Spring Boot in Java, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the most popular libraries for developing RESTful APIs are Flask, Fast API, and Django.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Flask** is a micro framework for developing RESTful APIs, which means that it is lightweight and provides the basic components for serving predictive models as web services. Flask is the easiest to learn and use in comparison to the other frameworks, and it is known for its simplicity and flexibility. However, it also has limitations in terms of functionality, since it is designed for low-volume APIs, and does not scale well to large applications. Also, Flask is a general-purpose web framework and may require importing additional libraries for specific functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fast API** is also a lightweight framework, but it is designed specifically for building web APIs quickly and efficiently. Fast API was introduced in 2018 and it is a newer framework, but it has quickly gained popularity among developers. Its unique characteristic is its speed, as it is the fastest Python framework. FastAPI is explicitly designed for building APIs, and offers many features for automating the building of APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Django** is a full-stack web framework, that has many built-in features and a specific project structure. This makes it more difficult to learn than Flask and Fast API. On the other hand, Django is a powerful framework that has been used in many large-scale projects as it offers various features for building APIs. This is considered advantageous by developers who want a more structured framework or who prefer a comprehensive solution without relying on many third-party packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other similar Python libraries for developing RESTful APIs. As well as, numerous frameworks for developing RESTful APIs as cloud services are available by the cloud providers such as Amazon SageMaker, Azure ML, Google Cloud ML, IBM Watson Cloud, and others. These cloud frameworks provide access to pretrained models, deployment of custom models, and allow easy integration of predictive models into users' applications.\n",

    "In this lecture we will demonstrate  building a web API for Data Science projects with Flask, due to its ease of use."

    "This section explains how to develop a RESTful API for classification of Iris flowers with the Fast API library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we try to develop the API, we need to install the required libraries with `pip install, fastapi, python-multipart, uvicorn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for the `app.py` server in Fast API is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import modules from Fast API for handling HTTP requests and exceptions, and for template rendering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we instantiate the `app` web application from the `FastAPI()` class. And we define the directory with the HTML templates. Fast API uses Jinja2 for template rendering, allowing to create dynamic HTML pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the Flask app, in Fast API we use the `@app.get('/')` decorator to associate the HTTP GET method with the default home page of the application. In Fast API, the `Request` class is used to handle the incoming requests, where `request` is an instance that contains the information about the HTTP request. The `index_view` function will render a template of the `index.html` file and will pass the `request` object to it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `'/predict'` route will handle the GET request. The `predict_class` function retrieves the input values `slen`, `swid`, `plen`, and `pwid` and calls `model.classify()` to predict the variety of the Iris flower. If there are no errors, the function will render a template of the `output.html` file and will pass the `variety` to be displayed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the web application is run using the `uvicorn` server. UVicorn is the default server for Fast API in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code for the Fast API app is similar to the Flask app, but there are several differences in the syntax and the implementation. "
